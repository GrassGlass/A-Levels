Spin singlet\nobreakspace  {}($S$) and triplet\nobreakspace  {}($T$) states are separated for clarity. The ionization level $I_\pi $ is shown at the top. Excited states as well as vibrational sublevels (dashed horizontal lines) are shown. Internal degradation is a non-radiative process, while fluorescence and phosphorescence are radiative decays. The decay $T_0 \to S_0$, however, is indirect, by interactions with other molecules.\relax }}{2}{}\protected@file@percent }
