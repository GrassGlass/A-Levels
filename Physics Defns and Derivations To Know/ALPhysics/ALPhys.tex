\chapter{Kinematics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Distance} is defined as the total length of \emph{path} travelled.
    \item \textit{Velocity} is defined as the rate of change of displacement.
    \item \textit{Acceleration} is defined as the rate of change of velocity.
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Dynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Newton's First Law of Motion} states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion at constant velocity in a straight line in the absence of an \emph{external} resultant force.
    \item The \textit{linear momentum} of a body is the product of its mass and velocity. The linear momentum is in the \emph{same direction} as it velocity.
    \item \textit{Newton's Second Law of Motion} states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and occurs \emph{in the direction} of the resultant force.
    \item \textit{Newton's Third Law of Motion} states that if body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts a force of the \emph{same type} that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on body A.
    \item \textit{Impulse} is defined as the product of \emph{average} force acting on an object and the time for which the force acts.
    \item The \textit{Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum} states that the total momentum of a system remains constant provided no \emph{external} resultant force acts on the system.
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Forces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Hooke's Law} states that the force is directly proportional to the extension in a material if its \emph{limit of proportionality} is not exceeded.
    \item The \textit{center of gravity} of an object is the point at which the entire weight of a body may be considered to act.
    \item The \textit{moment} of a force is equal to the product of the force and the \emph{perpendicular} distance of the \emph{line of action} of the force from the pivot. It is also the turning effect of a force.
    \item \textit{Torque of a couple} is defined as the product of one of the forces and the \emph{perpendicular} distance between the \emph{lines of action} of the forces.
    \item The \textit{Principle of Moments} states that if a body is in equilibrium, the sum of all the clockwise moments about \emph{any axis} must be equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments about the \emph{same axis}.
    \item \textit{Density} is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance.
    \item \textit{Pressure} is defined as force per unit area, where the force is \emph{acting perpendicularly} to the area.
    \item Deriving \(p=\rho gh\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider a point at a depth \(h\) below the surface of a liquid of density \(\rho\). 
        \item The force \(F\) acting perpendicularly on a surface area \(A\) at depth \(h\) is due to the weight of the liquid column above \(A\) to give pressure \(p\). Thus, \(p=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{mg}{A}=\frac{\rho Ah}{g}=\rho gh\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Upthrust} is the upward force exerted by a fluid on a body immersed in the fluid (due to pressure difference in the fluid).
    \item \textit{The origin of upthrust:} Upthrust is a result of the pressure difference between top and bottom surfaces of the body, resulting in a net upwards force being exerted on the body by the third medium in which the body is located.
    \item \textit{Archimedes' Principle} states that when a body is totally or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upward force (upthrust) equal to the weight of fluid displaced.
    \item \textit{The Principle of Floatation} states that, for any object floating in \emph{equilibrium}, the upthrust is equal to the weight of the object.
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Work, Energy, and Power}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Work done} is defined as the product of a force and the displacement in the direction of the force.
    \item \textit{One joule of work} is defined as the work done by a force of 1 Newton when its \emph{point of application} moves through a distance of 1 metre in the direction of the force.
    \item \textit{Energy} is defined as the ability to do work.
    \item \textit{The Principle of Conservation of Energy} states that energy can neither be created or destroyed in \emph{any process}. It can be transformed from one form to another, and transferred from one body to another.
    \item Deriving \(E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\): 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider a constant horizontal applied force \(F\) acting on an object of mass \(m\) travelling with initial velocity \(u\) to reach a final velocity \(v\) over a displacement \(s\). 
        \item For uniform acceleration, \(v^2=u^2+2as\) so \(as=\frac{1}{2}(v^2-u^2)\). Combined with Newton's Second Law, \(W=Fs=mas=\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mu^2\). When the object starts from rest, \(u=0\). 
        \item By conservation of energy,\emph{ the work done by force \(F\) must be converted into the kinetic energy \(E_k\) of the object}. Hence, \(E_k=W=\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}m(0)^2=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The \textit{Work-Energy Theorem} states that the net work done by \emph{external} forces acting on a particle is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the particle.
    \item Deriving \(E_p=mgh\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider an object from the Earth's surface --- which is taken as the reference for zero gravitational potential energy --- raised up by a \emph{constant force \(F\) equal to and opposite to the weight \(mg\)} of the object such that the object moves up at \emph{constant velocity} to a height \(h_2\). 
        \item Thus, the object moves at constant speed so \(\Delta E_k=0\). Therefore, 
        \begin{align*}
            \Delta E_p&= W\\
            E_p-0&=Fs\\
            E_p&=mgh.
        \end{align*}
        Where \(E_p\) is the gravitational potential energy at height \(h\) above the Earth's surface.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Know how to \(\Delta E_p=\frac{1}{2}kx^2\) from area under graph.
    \item \textit{Power} is defined as the rate of doing work.
    \item Derive \(P=Fv\): \(P=\frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}t}=\frac{F\text{d}s}{\text{d}t}=Fv\).
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Temperature and Ideal Gases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics} If bodies \(A\) and \(B\) are separately in thermal equilibrium with body \(C\), then bodies \(A\) and \(B\) are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
    \item \textit{One mole} is defined as the amount of substance that contains as many elementary particles as there are atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12.
    \item \textit{Avogadro's Constant \(N_A\)} is the number of atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12.

\chapter{First Law of Thermodynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{heat capacity} of a body is defined as the amount of thermal energy required to raise its temperature by one Kelvin / degree Celsius.

\end{itemize}
\chapter{Gravitational Fields}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Newton's Law of Gravitation} states that the force of attraction between any two point masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.
    \item A \textit{gravitational field} is a region in space where mass experiences a gravitational force acting on it.
    \item Gravitational field strength at a point is defined as the gravitational force per unit mass acting on a small mass placed at that point
    \item The \textit{gravitational potential energy} of a mass at a point is defined as the work done by an \emph{external agent} in bringing the mass \emph{from infinity} to that point (without any change in kinetic energy).
    \item \textit{Gravitational potential} at a point is defined as the work done per unit mass by an \emph{external agent} in bringing a mass \emph{from infinity} to that point (without a change in kinetic energy).
    \item Escape velocity is the \emph{minimum} velocity a mass needs to be projected from the \emph{surface} of the moon in order to have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the gravitational field it experiences and \emph{move to infinity}.
    \item Escape velocity \(v_\text{min}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}\) (where Min \(E_k\) needed is the gain in \(E_p\) to reach infinity).
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}[label=\(\square\)]
    \item \[
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large, column sep=large]
     U_G=-\frac{GMm}{r} \arrow{r}{-\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}r}} \arrow[swap]{d}{\frac{1}{m}} & F_G=-\frac{GMm}{r^2} \arrow[swap]{d}{\frac{1}{m}} \\
     \phi=-\frac{GM}{r} \arrow{r}{-\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}r}} & g=-\frac{GM}{r^2}\\
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\item \(U_G=m\phi\) \& \(\Delta U_G=m\Delta\phi\).
\item \(U_G\) is negative because infinity is taken as the reference point for zero potential energy. The work done against gravitational force in bringing a mass from infinity to that point is negative.
\item Gravitational force provides the centripetal force:
\begin{align*}
    F_G&=F_c\\
    \frac{GMm}{r^2}&=mr\omega^2=mr\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2\\
    T^2&=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3\\
    T^2 &\propto r^3
\end{align*}
\item Gravitational force provides the centripetal force:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    && F_G&=F_c\\
    &\text{For \(A\):}& \hspace{1cm} \frac{Gm_Am_B}{(r_A+r_B)^2}&=m_Ar_A\omega^2\\
    &\text{For \(B\):}& \frac{Gm_Am_B}{(r_A+r_B)^2}&=m_Br_B\omega^2
\end{alignat*}
The center of mass of the system is at point \(P\) where 
\[m_Ar_A=m_Br_B\]
such that both stars have the same angular velocity \(\omega\).
\item For binary star systems, notice that \emph{orbital radius is replaced by the stars' separation}:
\begin{align*}
    m_Ar_A&=m_Br_B& && \frac{Gm_Am_B}{(r_A+r_B)^2}&=m_Br_B\omega^2\\
    r_A+r_B&=\frac{m_B}{m_A}r_B+r_B& &\text{so}& &=\frac{m_Am_B}{m_A+m_B}(r_A+r_B)\omega^2\\
    r_B&=\frac{m_A}{m_A+m_B}(r_A+r_B)& && &\\
\end{align*}
So, rearranging, we have
\[\omega^2=\frac{G(m_A+m_B)}{(r_A+r_B)^3}=\frac{Gm_A}{r_B(r_A+r_B)^2} \qquad\text{and}\qquad T^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{G(m_A+m_B)}(r_A+r_B)^3.\]
\item Geostationary orbit facts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Only one such orbit at a \emph{fixed} distance of \(4.2\times10^7\text{m}\) from Earth's center,
    \item Orbital period of 24 hours,
    \item Satellite's plane of orbit coincides with the equatorial plane of the Earth,
    \item Orbits West to East (in the same direction as Earth's rotation). 
\end{enumerate}
\item Equipotential lines are not equally spaced because the gravitational field strength is not constant but decreases as one goes away from the Earth.
\item Assumptions made in the theory (e.g. in deriving \(g=-\frac{GM}{r^2}\)):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The bodies are separated by distances so large they can be considered as point particles (i.e. separation >> radius).
    \item The bodies are homogenous spheres (constant density throughout the sphere).
    \item The bodies have masses distributed symmetrically around the center in uniform layers.
    \item In the absence of other masses.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Oscillations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Simple harmonic motion} is defined as the motion of a body whose acceleration is directly proportional to its displacement from a fixed point (equilibrium position) and is always directed towards that fixed point.
    \item A \textit{freely oscillating} system oscillates at its own \textit{natural frequency} without \emph{external} influences other than the \emph{initial impulse when displaced} from its equilibrium position, with \emph{no dissipation} of energy.
    \item \textit{Damped oscillations} are oscillations in which the amplitude diminishes with time as a result of \emph{dissipative forces} that reduce the total energy of the oscillations.
    \item A system is in \textit{forced oscillations} when it is forced to oscillate at a frequency other than the natural frequency by a \emph{periodic external} force.
    \item \textit{Resonance} is a phenomenon that occurs when the frequency at which an object is being made to vibrate (the forced frequency of vibration) is equal equal to its natural frequency of vibration.

\chapter{Wave Motion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textit{progressive} wave is a wave in which \emph{energy is carried} from one point to another by means of \emph{vibrations or oscillations} within the wave. Particles within the wave are \emph{not transported along} the wave.
    \item A \textit{phase} is an angle which gives a measure of the \emph{fraction of a cycle} that has been \emph{completed} by an oscillating particle or by a wave.
    \item \emph{Intensity} of a wave is the wave energy incident per unit time per unit area \emph{normal} to the wave.
    \item \textit{Polarisation} of a wave refers to the \emph{confinement} of oscillations in \emph{only} one plane. The plane of oscillations is \emph{parallel} to the direction of energy transfer.  
    \item Malus' Law states that the intensity of a beam of \emph{plane polarised light} after passing through a rotatable polariser is directly proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle through which the polariser is rotated from the position that gives maximum intensity.

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Superposition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Principle of Superposition}: When two or more waves of the \emph{same type}, meet at \emph{a point in space}, the \emph{resultant displacement} of the waves at any point is the \emph{vector sum} of the \emph{displacements} due to \emph{each wave acting independently} at that point.

            \item Natural frequency of vibration depends on length of air column.
            \item When fork frequency is equal to natural frequency/odd multiple of fundamental frequency, resonance occurs. There is maximum energy transfer and maximum amplitude of vibrations, leading to maximum loudness.

        \item The sides of the central fringes are likely more reddish.

\chapter{Currents of Electricity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{number density} \(n\) is defined as the number of particles per unit volume.
    \item The \emph{drift velocity} \(v\) is the \emph{average} velocity at which \emph{charge carriers} move through a \emph{conductor} when there is \emph{electric current in the conductor}.
    \item Deriving the equation \(I=nAvq\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Assume that the \emph{current is constant}. Then, \(I=\frac{Q}{t}\).
        \item Assume that there are \(N\) charge carriers, \emph{each} carrying carry an \emph{equal amount of charge} \(q\). Then, the \emph{total charge} that passes through a cross-sectional area \(A\) is
        \[Q=Nq.\]
        \item Assume that the \emph{number density} \(n\) of charge carriers is \emph{uniform}. Then, the number of charge carriers passing through \(A\) in a time interval \(t\) is 
        \[N=nV,\]
        for the volume \(V\) covered by the current in that time.
        \item But \(V\) is just \(A\Delta x\). Moreover, since the current travels at some velocity \(v\), we have \[V=A\Delta x=Avt\]
        \item Therefore, 
        \[I=\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{Nq}{t}=\frac{nVq}{t}=\frac{nAvtq}{t}=nAvq.\]

    \item Elementary charge \(e=1.6\times 10^{-19}C\) (Charge of an electron/proton).

    \item \emph{Ohm's Law} states that the \emph{current} flowing in a \emph{conductor} is \emph{directly proportional} to the \emph{potential difference across it} under \emph{constant physical conditions}.
    \item \emph{Resistance} is defined as the \emph{ratio} of the \emph{potential difference across} the conductor to the \emph{current} flowing through it.
    \item \emph{Resistivity} \(\rho\) is the \emph{proportionality constant} between the \emph{dimensions of a specimen of a material} and its \emph{resistance} such that

    \item An \emph{electric field} is a \emph{region in space} where a \emph{charge experiences an electric force}.
    \item How to draw electric field lines: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Lines cannot intersect} one another.
        \item Lines must \emph{begin from positive charges} and \emph{end on negative charges}.
        \item Arrows show the \emph{direction of force} exerted on a positive test charge.
        \item The \emph{greater} the electric field strength, the \emph{closer} together field lines are drawn.
        \item Lines leave/end on \emph{conducting surfaces} at \emph{right angles}
    \end{itemize}

  \item The \emph{electric field strength} at a point is defined as the \emph{electric force} per \emph{unit positive charge} placed at that point.
  \item The formula is, for a small stationary test charge \(q\),
  \[E=\frac{F_E}{q}.\]
  \item Electric field strength of a positive point charge:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../images/ElectricFieldStrengthPlot.png}
  \end{center}
  \item Charge distribution on a conducting sphere: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Excess charges are forced to the surface of the conductor until the electric field inside the conductor is zero. 
    \item \emph{Outside} the conductor, the electric field is the \emph{same} as that of an isolated point charge equal to the excess charge. 
  \end{itemize}
  \item Properties of conductors in \emph{electrostatic equilibrium}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{electric field is zero inside} a conductor (regardless of shape).
    \item So, the \emph{entire conductor} is at the \emph{same potential}.
    \item Just outside the conductor, the e-field lines are \emph{perpendicular to its surface}, starting and ending on charges on the surface.
    \item \emph{Excess charges} resides exclusively on \emph{the surfaces} of a conductor.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Electric field strength between two charged parallel plates is uniform everywhere between the plates, except at both ends of the plates. 
  \item Also, \emph{charges} between the plates experience \emph{uniform acceleration}.
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{../ParallelPlates/testing.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \item Magnitude of electric field strength between the plates:
  \[E=\frac{dV}{dr}=\frac{\Delta V}{d}.\]
\end{itemize}
