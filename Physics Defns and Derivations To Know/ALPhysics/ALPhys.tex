\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Distance} is defined as the total length of \emph{path} travelled.
    \item \emph{Displacement} is defined as the distance of a point from some reference point \emph{in a specified direction}.
    \item \emph{Velocity} is defined as the rate of change of displacement.
    \item \emph{Acceleration} is defined as the rate of change of velocity.
    \item Four key formulas for kinematics. When the  acceleration \(a\) is constant:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(v=u+at\),
        \item \(s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2\),
        \item \(s=\frac{1}{2}(u+v)t\),
        \item \(v^2=u^2+2as\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Dynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Newton's First Law of Motion} states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion at constant velocity in a straight line in the absence of an \emph{external} resultant force.
    \item The \emph{linear momentum} of a body is the product of its mass and velocity. The linear momentum is in the \emph{same direction} as it velocity.
    \item \emph{Newton's Second Law of Motion} states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and occurs \emph{in the direction} of the resultant force.
    \item \emph{Newton's Third Law of Motion} states that if body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts a force of the \emph{same type} that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on body A.
    \item \emph{Impulse} is defined as the product of \emph{average} force acting on an object and the time for which the force acts.
    \item The \emph{Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum} states that the total momentum of a system remains constant provided no \emph{external} resultant force acts on the system. i.e.
    \[m_1u_1+m_2u_2=m_1v_1+m_2v_2.\]
    \item A elastic collision is on where kinetic energy is conserved. i.e.
    \[m_1u_1^2+m_2u_2^2=m_1v_1^2+m_2v_2^2.\]
    \item The below table provides a quick shortcut, that is particularly helpful in solving multiple choice questions fast. We assume a mass \(m_1\) is moving with velocity \(u\) towards a \emph{stationary} (\(u_2=0\)) mass \(m_2\).

            \midrule
            \(m_1=m_2\) & \(0\) & \(u\)\\
            \(m_1\ll m_2\) & \(\approx -u\) & \(\approx 0\)\\
            \(m_1\gg m_2\) & \(\approx u\) & \(\approx 2u\)\\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Special cases of elastic collisions.}
        \label{table:elastic-collisions}
    \end{table}
    \item For an elastic collision, the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed after collision:
    \[u_1\highlight[green!50]{-u_2}=v_2\highlight[green!50]{-v_1}.\]
    \emph{Note.} The formula is \textcolor{red}{\emph{not} \(u_1-u_2=v_1-v_2\)}.
    \item An inelastic collision is one where kinetic energy is not conserved. 
    \item In a perfectly inelastic collision, the masses coalesce (become one) and move off with the same velocity. In other words,
    \[m_1u_1+m_2u_2=(m_1+m_2)v.\]

    \item State what is meant by a field of force. 
    \item A field of force due to a body's property (e.g. charge, mass) is a region in space in which a body carrying that property experiences a force when it is placed in the field.
    \item \emph{Hooke's Law} states that the magnitude of the force acting on a spring directly proportional to the extension in the spring, if the \emph{limit of proportionality} of the spring is not exceeded.
    \item The \emph{center of gravity} of an object is the point at which the entire weight of a body may be considered to act.

\chapter{Work, Energy, and Power}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Work done} is defined as the product of a force and the displacement in the direction of the force.
    \item \emph{One joule of work} is defined as the work done by a one Newton force when its \emph{point of application} is displaced one metre in the direction of the force.
    \item \emph{Energy} is defined as the ability to do work.
    \item \emph{The Principle of Conservation of Energy} states that energy can neither be created or destroyed in \emph{any process}. It can be transformed from one form to another, and transferred from one body to another.
    \item Deriving \(E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\): 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider a constant horizontal applied force \(F\) acting on an object of mass \(m\) travelling with initial velocity \(u\) to reach a final velocity \(v\) over a displacement \(s\). 
        \item For uniform acceleration, \(v^2=u^2+2as\) so \(as=\frac{1}{2}(v^2-u^2)\). Combined with Newton's Second Law, \(W=Fs=mas=\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mu^2\). When the object starts from rest, \(u=0\). 
        \item By conservation of energy,\emph{ the work done by force \(F\) must be converted into the kinetic energy \(E_k\) of the object}. Hence, \(E_k=W=\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}m(0)^2=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The \emph{Work-Energy Theorem} states that the \emph{net} work done by \emph{external} forces acting on a particle is equal to the \emph{net} change in kinetic energy of the particle.
    \item Deriving \(E_p=mgh\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider an object from the Earth's surface --- which is taken as the reference for zero gravitational potential energy --- raised up by a \emph{constant force \(F\) equal to and opposite to the weight \(mg\)} of the object such that the object moves up at \emph{constant velocity} to a height \(h\). 
        \item Thus, the object moves at constant speed so \(\Delta E_k=0\). Therefore, 
        \begin{align*}
            \Delta E_p&= W\\
            E_p-0&=Fs\\
            \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad
            E_p&=mgh, \qquad\text{by Newton's Second Law.}
        \end{align*}
        where \(E_p\) is the gravitational potential energy at height \(h\) above the Earth's surface.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Know how to derive \(\Delta E_p=\frac{1}{2}kx^2\) from area under graph.
    \item \emph{Power} is defined as the rate of doing work.
    \item Derive \(P=Fv\): \(P=\frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}t}=\frac{\text{d}(Fs)}{\text{d}t}=F\frac{ds}{dt}=Fs\) for a constant force \(F\).
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Temperature and Ideal Gases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item From empirical results, we know that there appears to be a \emph{linear} trend, wherein pressure and volume decrease, when temperature decreases. So, there must be a temperature where pressure is zero, and a temperature where volume is zero. Empirical data shows that the temperature at which this occurs is the same for all gases under all experimental conditions. This temperature is known as \emph{absolute zero}.
    \item The \emph{Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics} states that if bodies \(A\) and \(B\) are separately in thermal equilibrium with body \(C\), then bodies \(A\) and \(B\) are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
    \item \emph{One mole} is defined as the amount of substance that contains as many elementary particles as there are atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12.
    \item \emph{Avogadro's Constant \(N_A\)} is the number of atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12.
    \item Celsius-Kelvin conversion: \(T\ {^\circ}\text{C}=(T+273.15)\ \text{K}\).

        \label{fig:celsius-kelvin}
    \end{figure}
    \item An \emph{ideal gas} is a \emph{hypothetical gas} that \emph{perfectly} obeys the \emph{equation of state} for an ideal gas, at \emph{all} pressures, temperatures, and volumes. The equation of state is \(pV=nRT\), where 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[\(p:\)] pressure of ideal gas
        \item[\(V:\)] volume of ideal gas
        \item[\(n:\)] number of moles of ideal gas
        \item[\(R:\)] molar gas constant
        \item[\(T:\)] temperature of ideal gas.     
    \end{enumerate}
    \item There is no ideal gas in nature, but at \emph{low pressures} and \emph{high temperatures}, real gases behave like ideal gases.
    \item \emph{Boyle's Law}. When the temperature of an ideal gas remains constant, the product of its pressure \(p\) and volume \(V\) is constant. i.e. \(p_1V_1=p_2V_2\).
    \item \emph{Charles' Law}. When the pressure of an ideal gas remains constant, its volume \(V\) is directly proportional to its thermodynamic temperature \(T/K\). i.e. \(V_1/T_1=V_2/T_2\).
    \item \emph{Gay-Lussac's Law}. When the volume of an ideal gas remains constant, its pressure \(p\) is directly proportional to its thermodynamic temperature \(T/K\). i.e. \(p_1/T_1=p_2/T_2\).
    \item Let \(n\) be the amount of gas in moles and the integer \(N\) be the number of gas molecules. Then, for the molar gas constant \(R=8.31\) J K\(^{-1}\) mol\(^{-1}\) and Boltzmann's constant \(k=1.38\cdot 10^{-23}\) J K\(^{-1}\), the equation of state for an ideal gas is \(pV=nRT=NkT\).
    \item Some useful conversions: \(n=\frac{\text{g}}{\text{g/mol}}=\frac{N}{N_A}\). E.g. \(^{12}_6\text{C}\) and \(^{16}_8\text{O}\) so the molecular mass of CO is \(12+16=28\) g/mol.

    \item How would the force exerted by gas differ in the presence of intermolecular forces, compared to the ideal case? Particles would attract each other, so the average force on the wall will decrease.   
    \item Real gases are approximately ideal at high temperatures and low pressures.
    \item Deriving \(p=\frac{1}{3}\frac{Nm}{V}\langle c^2 \rangle\) for an ideal gas:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider a cubic container of side \(l\) containing \(N\) molecules, each of mass m.
        \item The change in momentum of one molecule due to its \emph{elastic} collision with the container wall is \(2mc_x\)
        \item The time interval between collisions of this molecule with the same wall is \(\Delta t=\frac{2l}{c_x}\).
        \item By Newton's 2nd Law, the net force \(F\) experienced by one molecule is equal to the rate of change of momentum it experiences. i.e. \(F=\frac{2mc_x}{\frac{2l}{c_x}}=\frac{mc_x^2}{l}\).
        \item By Newton's 3rd Law, since the molecule and the container wall form an action-reaction pair, the net force experienced by the container wall (due to this one molecule) is \(F\).
        \item The pressure experienced by the wall due to this one molecule is \(p=\frac{mc_x^2}{l^3}=\frac{mc_x^2}{V}\).
        \item The pressure experienced by the wall due to \(N\) molecules is \(p_N=\frac{Nmc_x^2}{V}\).
        \item The molecules can move in three directions, so \(c^2=c_x^2+c_y^2+c_z^2\). Since the molecules' motion is random, \(\langle c_x^2 \rangle=\langle c_y^2 \rangle=\langle c_z^2 \rangle\). Hence \(\langle c^2 \rangle=3\langle c_x^2 \rangle\). 
        \item Now, \(p_N=\frac{Nm\langle \frac{1}{3}c^2\rangle}{V}=\frac{1}{3}\frac{Nm\langle c^2 \rangle}{V}\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The mean translational kinetic energy of an ideal gas molecule molecule is \(\frac{1}{2}m \langle c^2 \rangle=\frac{3}{2}kT\).
    \item The total translational kinetic energy of \(N\) ideal gas molecules is \(\frac{3}{2}NkT=\frac{3}{2}nRT=\frac{3}{2}pV\).

\chapter{First Law of Thermodynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{heat capacity} of a body is defined as the amount of thermal energy required to raise its temperature by one Kelvin / degree Celsius. 
    \item The specific \emph{heat capacity} of a body is defined as the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of one unit mass of the substance by one Kelvin / degree Celsius.
    \item For a substance of mass \(m\), heat capacity \(C\), and specific heat capacity \(c\), we write \(Q=C\Delta\theta=mc\Delta\theta\).
    \item The \emph{specific latent heat} of a body is defined as the thermal energy required to change \emph{phase} of one unit mass of a substance, \emph{without a change in temperature}.
    \item For a substance of specific latent heat of fusion (vaporisation), we write \(Q=mL_f\) (\(Q=mL_v\)).
    \item \emph{Internal energy} of a system is a sum of \emph{random distribution} of kinetic and potential energies \emph{associated with the molecules} of the system. Microscopic potential energy is due to the intermolecular forces between the molecules. Microscopic kinetic energy is due to the random motion of the molecules. 
    \item An ideal monoatomic gas of \(N\) atoms only has translational motion and no intermolecular potential energy, \(U=E_k=N\cdot\text{translational \(E_k\) of one atom}=\frac{3}{2}NkT\).
    \item For non-monoatomic ideal gases, \(U\neq \frac{3}{2}NkT\). But we know that \(U_{\text{Total}}\propto NT\) and \(U_{\text{one molecule}}\propto T\).
    \item The \emph{First Law of Thermodynamics} states that the \emph{increase} in internal energy of a closed system is the \emph{sum} of heat \emph{supplied} to the system and the work done \emph{on} the system. i.e. \(\Delta U=Q+W\).
    \item The work done \(W\) on a gas against a constant external pressure \(p\) is such that \(W=-p\Delta V\).
    \item In general, the work done on a gas is \(W=-\int_{V_i}^{V_f}p\,dV\).
    \item An \emph{\textcolor{blue}{isothermal} process} is one that takes place without a change in temperature, i.e. \(\Delta T=0\). Thus, for an ideal gas (possibly non-monoatomic), \(\Delta U=0\) since \(U\propto T\).
    \item An \emph{\textcolor{pink!75!red}{iso-volumetric/isochoric} process} is one that takes place without a change in volume, i.e. \(\Delta V=0\). Hence, when the external pressure is constant, \(W=0\).  
    \item An \emph{\textcolor{green!85!black}{isobaric} process} is one that takes place without a change in pressure, i.e. \(\Delta p=0\).
    \item An \emph{\textcolor{red!60!black}{adiabatic} process} is one that takes place without heat transfer, i.e. \(Q=0\). Therefore, \(U=W\).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Newton's Law of Gravitation} states that the force of attraction between any two point masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.
    \item A \emph{gravitational field} is a region in space where mass experiences a gravitational force acting on it.
    \item Gravitational field strength at a point is defined as the gravitational force per unit mass acting on a small mass placed at that point
    \item The \emph{gravitational potential energy} of a mass at a point is defined as the work done by an \emph{external agent} in bringing the mass \emph{from infinity} to that point (without any net change in kinetic energy).
    \item \emph{Gravitational potential} at a point is defined as the work done per unit mass by an \emph{external agent} in bringing a mass \emph{from infinity} to that point (without a net change in kinetic energy).
    \item Escape velocity is the \emph{minimum} velocity a mass needs to be projected from the \emph{surface} of the Earth in order to have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the gravitational field it experiences and \emph{move to infinity}.
    \item Escape velocity \(v_\text{min}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}\) (where Min \(E_k\) needed is the gain in \(E_p\) to reach infinity).
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}[label=\(\square\)]
    \item \[
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large, column sep=large]
     U_G=-\frac{GMm}{r} \arrow{r}{-\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}r}} \arrow[swap]{d}{\frac{1}{m}} & F_G=-\frac{GMm}{r^2} \arrow[swap]{d}{\frac{1}{m}} \\
     \phi=-\frac{GM}{r} \arrow{r}{-\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}r}} & g=-\frac{GM}{r^2}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\item \(U_G=m\phi\) \& \(\Delta U_G=m\Delta\phi\).
\item \(U_G\) is negative because infinity is taken as the reference point for zero potential energy. The work done against gravitational force in bringing a mass from infinity to that point is negative.
\item Gravitational force provides the centripetal force:
\begin{align*}
    F_G&=F_C\\
    \frac{GMm}{r^2}&=\frac{mv^2}{r}\\
    E_k&=\frac{GMm}{2r}
\end{align*}
Thus, \(E_T=U_G+E_K=-\frac{GMm}{2r}\).
\item Gravitational force provides the centripetal force:
\begin{align*}
    F_G&=F_c\\
    \frac{GMm}{r^2}&=mr\omega^2=mr\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2\\
    T^2&=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3\\
    T^2 &\propto r^3
\end{align*}
\item Gravitational force provides the centripetal force:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    && F_G&=F_c\\
    &\text{For \(A\):}& \hspace{1cm} \frac{Gm_Am_B}{(r_A+r_B)^2}&=m_Ar_A\omega^2\\
    &\text{For \(B\):}& \frac{Gm_Am_B}{(r_A+r_B)^2}&=m_Br_B\omega^2
\end{alignat*}
The center of mass of the system is at point \(P\) where 
\[m_Ar_A=m_Br_B\]
such that both stars have the same angular velocity \(\omega\).
\item For binary star systems, notice that \emph{orbital radius is replaced by the stars' separation}:
\begin{align*}
    m_Ar_A&=m_Br_B& && \frac{Gm_Am_B}{(r_A+r_B)^2}&=m_Br_B\omega^2\\
    r_A+r_B&=\frac{m_B}{m_A}r_B+r_B& &\text{so}& &=\frac{m_Am_B}{m_A+m_B}(r_A+r_B)\omega^2\\
    r_B&=\frac{m_A}{m_A+m_B}(r_A+r_B)& && &\\
\end{align*}
So, rearranging, we have
\[\omega^2=\frac{G(m_A+m_B)}{(r_A+r_B)^3}=\frac{Gm_A}{r_B(r_A+r_B)^2} \qquad\text{and}\qquad T^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{G(m_A+m_B)}(r_A+r_B)^3.\]
\item Geostationary orbit facts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Only one such orbit at a \emph{fixed} distance of \(4.2\times10^7\text{m}\) from Earth's center,
    \item Orbital period of 24 hours,
    \item Satellite's plane of orbit coincides with the equatorial plane of the Earth,
    \item Orbits West to East (in the same direction as Earth's rotation). 
\end{enumerate}
\item Equipotential lines are not equally spaced because gravitational field strength is not constant but decreases as one goes away from the Earth.
\item Assumptions made in the theory (e.g. in deriving \(g=-\frac{GM}{r^2}\)):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The bodies are separated by distances so large they can be considered as point particles (i.e. separation >> radius).
    \item The bodies are homogenous spheres (constant density throughout the sphere).
    \item The bodies have masses distributed symmetrically around their centers in uniform layers.
    \item In the absence of other masses.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Simple harmonic motion} is defined as the motion of a body whose acceleration is directly proportional to its displacement from a fixed point (equilibrium position) and is always directed towards that fixed point.
    \item A \emph{freely oscillating} system oscillates at its own \emph{natural frequency} without \emph{external} influences other than the \emph{initial impulse when displaced} from its equilibrium position, with \emph{no dissipation} of energy.
    \item \emph{Damped oscillations} are oscillations in which the amplitude diminishes with time as a result of \emph{dissipative forces} that reduce the total energy of the oscillations.
    \item A system is in \emph{forced oscillations} when it is forced to oscillate at a frequency other than the natural frequency by a \emph{periodic external} force.
    \item \emph{Resonance} is a phenomenon that occurs when the frequency at which an object is being made to vibrate (the forced frequency of vibration) is equal equal to its natural frequency of vibration.

\chapter{Superposition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Principle of Superposition}: When two or more waves of the \emph{same type}, meet at \emph{a point in space}, the \emph{resultant displacement} of the waves at that point is the \emph{vector sum} of the \emph{displacements} due to \emph{each wave acting independently} at that point.
    \item \emph{Stationary waves} are waves whose \emph{waveforms do not advance} and where there is \emph{no net translation of energy}. The \emph{amplitude} of the waves varies according to \emph{position} from zero at the nodes to a maximum at the antinodes.
    \item A stationary wave is formed when two \emph{progressive} waves
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Having the \emph{same frequency} and \emph{same speed}
        \item Travel in \emph{opposite directions} towards each other
        \item Have \emph{similar amplitudes}
        \item Are unpolarised, or polarised along the same axis
        \item Are \emph{superposed}

        Explain, with reference to resonance, why the loudness of sound changes as the water level changes.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Natural frequency of vibration depends on length of air column.
            \item When fork frequency is equal to natural frequency/odd multiple of fundamental frequency, resonance occurs. There is maximum energy transfer and maximum amplitude of vibrations, leading to maximum loudness.
            \item When fork frequency is not equal to natural frequency, no resonance occurs and loudness drops.

        Sound from a loudspeaker reaches a point by two path of differing lengths. Explain why the amplitude of the sound varies from a maximum to a minimum, and back to a maximum, when the frequency is gradually increased. \hspace*{\fill} [2]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item When the frequency is gradually increased, the wavelength gradually decreases, causing the sound wave to vary from meeting in phase, to antiphase, and back in phase. \hspace*{\fill} [1]
            \item When they are in phase, constructive interference occurs, producing a maximum. When both waves are in antiphase, destructive interference occurs, resulting in a minimum. \hspace*{\fill} [1]

    \item \emph{Diffraction} is the \emph{bending or spreading out} of waves when they travel through a \emph{small opening} or when they pass round a \emph{small obstacle}.

    \item The wavelength before and after diffraction should be around the same.

        \item Light passing through each slit undergoes single-slit diffraction, where the intensity is maximum at the central bright fringe.
        \item The central bright fringe formed due to double-slit diffraction has a higher intensity because it was formed from the superposition of two single slit diffraction patterns coming from each slit.

        \item The zeroth order fringes of all the wavelengths coincide at the center where the path difference from the two slits is zero for all wavelengths. The combined central fringes remains white.
        \item The sides of the central fringes are likely more reddish.

\chapter{Currents of Electricity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{number density} \(n\) is defined as the number of particles per unit volume.
    \item The \emph{drift velocity} \(v\) is the \emph{average} velocity at which \emph{charge carriers} move through a \emph{conductor} when there is \emph{electric current in the conductor}.
    \item Deriving the equation \(I=nAvq\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Assume that the \emph{current is constant}. Then, \(I=\frac{Q}{t}\).
        \hspace*{0pt}\hfill \(\highlight[yellow]{[n]}\)
        \item Assume that there are \(N\) charge carriers passing through a cross-sectional area \(A\) in time \(t\), and that \emph{each} of them carries an \emph{identical amount of charge} \(q\). Then, the \emph{total charge} that passing through \(A\) in time \(t\) is
        \[Q=Nq \tag*{\(\highlight[yellow]{[N,A(t),Q(t)]}\)}.\]
        \item Assume that the \emph{number density} \(n\) of charge carriers is \emph{uniform}, and let \(V\) be the volume covered by the current in time \(t\). Thus,
        \[N=nV \tag*{\(\highlight[yellow]{[n,V(t)]}\)}.\]
        \item Furthermore, since the current travels at some velocity \(v\),
        \[V=A\Delta x=Avt \tag*{\(\highlight[yellow]{[v]}\)}.\]
        \item Therefore, 
        \[I=\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{Nq}{t}=\frac{nVq}{t}=\frac{nAvtq}{t}=nAvq.\]
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Elementary charge \(e=1.6\times 10^{-19}C\) (Charge of an electron/proton).
    \item The \emph{potential difference} between \emph{two points} of a circuit is defined as the amount of electrical energy \emph{converted} to other forms of energy \emph{per unit charge} moved \emph{between} the two points. 
    \item \emph{Ohm's Law} states that the \emph{current} flowing in a \emph{conductor} is \emph{directly proportional} to the \emph{potential difference across it} under \emph{constant physical conditions}.
    \item \emph{Resistance} is defined as the \emph{ratio} of the \emph{potential difference across} the conductor to the \emph{current} flowing through it.
    \item \emph{Resistivity} \(\rho\) is the \emph{proportionality constant} between the \emph{dimensions of a specimen of a material} and its \emph{resistance} such that 
    \[R=\frac{\rho L}{A}.\]

    \item For \(n\) identical resistors in parallel, which are each of resistance \(R\), we have \(R_{\text{effective}}=R/n\). Furthermore, the effective resistance is at most the resistance of the smallest resistor, i.e. \(R_{\text{effective}}\leq R_i\) for each \(i\). In fact, the inequality is strict when the number of resistors in parallel \(n\geq 2\).
    \item To resolve tricky systems of resistors, use the fact that electric potential is constant along a wire.

\chapter{Electromagnetic Induction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Magnetic flux} is the \emph{product} of \emph{an area} and the component of \emph{magnetic flux density perpendicular} to that area.
    \item In other words, let \(A\) be an area in a uniform magnetic field, of flux density \(B_\perp\) perpendicular to \(A\). Then, the magnetic flux \(\Phi\) through \(A\) is
    \[\Phi=B_\perp A.\]
    \item The area \(A\) here is a \emph{vector}! When we flip it through \(\pi\) radians, the magnetic flux through it is now \(-\Phi=-B_\perp A\). 
    \item \emph{One weber} is the \emph{magnitude of magnetic flux} through an \emph{area of} \(1\text{m}^2\) when a \emph{magnetic field of} \(1\text{T}\) acts \emph{perpendicularly into} the area.
    \item \emph{Magnetic flux linkage} through a coil is defined as the \emph{product} of the \emph{number of turns} of the coil and the magnetic flux through each turn of the coil.
    \item The magnetic flux linkage through a coil of \(N\) turns is hence
    \[N\Phi=NB_\perp A.\]
    \item \emph{Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction} states that the \emph{e.m.f. induced} in a \emph{conductor} is \emph{directly proportional} to the \emph{rate of change of magnetic flux linkage}.
    \item \emph{Lenz's Law} states that the \emph{direction of the induced e.m.f.} is such that it may produce \emph{an effect} that \emph{opposes the change} causing it.
    \item Lenz's Law is a consequence of conservation of energy. Mechanical work done to enable the change in magnetic flux linkage is converted into electrical energy.
    \item Faraday's and Lenz's Laws imply that the e.m.f generated is
    \[E=-(N\Phi)'=-(NB_\perp A)'.\]
    (The negative sign indicates that the induced e.m.f. opposes the change in magnetic flux linkage.)

    \item Faraday's Paradox. Consider a metal disc with of area \(A\) rotating at frequency \(f\) in a uniform magnetic field, of flux density \(B\). Then, let \(\text{O}\) be the centre of the disk, and pick any point \(P\) along the circumference of the disk. We see that \(A'\), the area swept by \(\text{OP}\) per unit time, is \(\pi r^2f\). So, by Faraday's Law,
    \[E=B\pi r^2f.\]

\chapter{Alternating Current}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An \emph{alternating current (a.c.) source} creates an electrical \emph{current} that varies in magnitude \emph{and} direction \emph{periodically with time}, as opposed to a \emph{direct current} (d.c.) source where the \emph{direction} of the current stays \emph{constant}. 
    \item Alternating current \emph{must change direction}. For instance, the following two functions, namely \(I=sin(t)+1\) and \(I=cos(t)+1\), are both (varying) direct currents.
    \begin{center}

        \caption[figure]{\ref{Varying direct current} Direct currents.}
    \end{center}
    \item A \(k\,\text{V}\) \(f\,\text{Hz}\) a.c. supply is one which has \(\text{V}_\text{rms}=k\) and frequency \(f\).
    \item The \emph{root-mean-square} (r.m.s.) value \(I_{\text{rms}}\) (or \(V\text{rms}\)) of an \emph{alternating current} (or alternating voltage) is the value of a \emph{steady direct current} (or direct voltage) that would produce the \emph{same average power} in a given resistor.
    \item We denote the mean value of a quantity \(x\) by \(\langle x \rangle\). So, \(x_{rms}=\sqrt{\langle x^2 \rangle}\), and it also holds that
    \[\langle P \rangle=I_\text{rms}^2R=\frac{V_\text{rms}^2}{R}.\]
    \item Steps to determine the rms value: square \(\to\) mean  \(\to\) root.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Square all values of \(I\) (or \(V\)).
        \item Find the mean square value \(\langle I^2 \rangle\) (or \(\langle V^2 \rangle\)). This is just the area under the graph of \(I^2\) (or \(V^2\)) against \(t\) in one period.
        \item Square root the value obtained above.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Note that for a \emph{full wave sinusoidal} alternating current (which an be assumed unless otherwise stated), 
    \[\langle P \rangle=\frac{1}{2}P_0,\qquad V_{\text{rms}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}V_0,\quad\text{and}\quad I_{\text{rms}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}I_0.\]
    \item Explain why in the selection of a suitable fuse, the r.m.s. current is considered instead of the peak current. \hspace*{\fill} [2]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The fuse will only be blown if its rating is \emph{lower} than the \emph{r.m.s.} current. \hspace*{\fill} [1]
        \item The peak current only occurs for a very short time. Hence, the \emph{heat dissipated} by the peak current is \emph{insufficient} to blow the fuse. \hspace*{\fill} [1]
    \end{itemize}
    \item Transformers. Let \(N_P\), \(V_P\), and \(I_P\) be the number of turns, rms voltage, and rms current, respectively, in the primary winding. (The peak voltage/current works too, for a sinusoidal wave form, by proportionality.) Similarly define \(N_S\), \(V_S\), and \(I_S\) for the secondary winding. Then,
    \[\text{the turns ratio}\coloneq\frac{N_S}{N_P}=\frac{V_S}{V_P}=\frac{I_P}{I_S}.\]
    (To quickly determine which side carries a greater voltage, we can use the principle of `more turns, more voltage'.)
    \item A step up transformer is one that increases voltage, i.e. \(V_S>V_P\) (or \(N_S>N_P\)).
    \item A step down transformer is one that decreases voltage, i.e. \(V_P>V_S\) (or \(N_P>N_S\)).

    \end{center}
    \item Transformers cannot be used for \emph{constant} direct current. Since there is no change in voltage/current, no emf will be (constantly) induced in the secondary coil. 
    \item When the direct current varies, however, there will be an \emph{alternating} current induced.
    \item Energy loss in a transformer.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Winding resistance. Current flowing through the windings causes \emph{resistive heating} of the conductors.
        \item Hysteresis losses. Each time the \emph{magnetic field is reversed}, a small amount of energy is lost due to hysteresis within the core.
        \item Magnetostriction. Magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic fore causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field. This produces a \emph{buzzing sound} and can cause losses due to \emph{frictional heating}.
        \item Mechanical losses. The alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating forces between the primary and secondary windings. These cause vibrations within nearby metalwork, adding to the \emph{buzzing noise} and \emph{consuming a small amount of power}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Power is typically transmitted at high voltages to minimise the power lost during transmission.
    \item Rectification.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \emph{half-wave rectification} converts only \emph{half} of the a.c. into d.c. by allowing current flow in only one direction.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item The diode is \emph{forward-biased} and has almost zero resistance, allowing the flow of current through the circuit.
                \item There is negligible p.d. (approximately zero) across the diode due to the low resistance.
                \item Thus, p.d. \(V_R\) across the resistor \(R\) is equal to the a.c. input voltage.
                \item So, when the diode is forward-biased, \(V_R\) follows the a.c. supply.

            \item Latter half cycle (`negative' \(V\) and \(I\))
            \begin{itemize}

                \item The p.d. across the diode is equal to the a.c. input supply voltage as its resistance is very much larger than \(R\).
                \item Thus, the p.d. \(V_R\) across \(R\) is negligible.
                \item So, when the diode is reverse-biased, \(V_R=0\).

    \item The \emph{de Broglie wavelength} of any particle is given by \(\lambda=h/p\).
    \item The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that \(\Delta p\Delta x\gtrsim h\), where \(p\) and \(x\) are the momentum and position, respectively, of a particle. 
    \item \emph{Note.} The above applies only when considering the momentum \(p\) and position \(x\) \emph{in the same direction}. So, it is possible that, for example, \(\Delta x\Delta p_y=0\) or \(\Delta y\Delta p_x=0\).
    \item The energy of a photon involved in the transition between energy levels obeys energy conservation. i.e. \(hf=E_f-E_i\) where \(f\) is the photon's frequency.
    \item Some terminology.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \emph{ground state} of an atom is the lowest state an atom can be at, such that all electrons in the atom occupy the lowest possible energy levels.
        \item An atom is said to be \emph{excited} iff one or more of its electrons are not occupying the lowest possible energy states.
        \item For this topic, \emph{ionisation} is the removal of an electron to create an ion.
        \item The \emph{ionisation energy} of an atom is the energy required for the atom to transition from the \(n=1\) to \(n=\infty\) state.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Why do energy levels have negative values? Electrons have \emph{zero potential energy at infinity}, and so have \emph{less} potential energy (i.e. negative potential energy) near the \emph{positively} charged nucleus.

    \item[\AsteriskThin] A \emph{isotope} is one of two or more atoms with the \emph{same atomic number} but \emph{different number of neutrons}.
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{unified atomic mass unit} \(u\) is equivalent to \emph{one-twelfth} of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. i.e. 1 \(u=1.66\cdot 10^{-27}\) kg.
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{mass defect} is the amount by which the mass of an atomic \emph{nucleus} is less than the sum of the masses of its \emph{constituent particles}. i.e.
    \[\text{mass defect }\Delta m=\text{sum of masses of nucleons}-\text{mass of nucleus}.\]
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{binding energy} of a nucleus is the amount of energy that is required to \emph{break a nucleus} into its \emph{constituent nucleons}.
    \item Binding energy is not a form of stored energy. 
    \item Mass-energy equivalence: \(E=mc^2\).
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{binding energy per nucleon} is defined as the \emph{binding energy} of a nucleus divided by the \emph{number of nucleons} in the nucleus.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\AsteriskThin] Radioactive decay is the \emph{spontaneous} and \emph{random} disintegration of atomic nuclei into another (nuclear) species through the \emph{emission} of alpha or beta particles or the de-excitation of nuclei to lower energy states through the emission of gamma radiation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Spontaneous} means that the nucleus decays because it is \emph{unstable}, not because of \emph{external conditions}.
        \item \emph{Random} means that it is impossible to predict \emph{which} nucleus will delay or \emph{when} a particular nucleus will decay.
    \end{itemize}
    \item[\AsteriskThin] \emph{Background radiation} is the radiation detected by a \emph{radiation counter} when \emph{no radioactive source} is nearby.
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{activity} \(A\) of a radioactive isotope is defined as the number of \emph{nuclear disintegrations per unit time}.
    \item The count rate \(C\) is the rate at which counts are triggered on a ratemeter, by ionising radiation. 
    \item \emph{Note.} The count rate is \emph{not the same} as activity. In fact, \(C\leq A\) because not all emissions --- stemming from radioactive decay --- are counted. Some reasons include:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Not all the radiation is directed towards the detector.
        \item Some of the radiation will be absorbed in the source itself, and by the air between the source and the detector. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{decay constant} \(\lambda\) of a \emph{sample of a radioactive nuclide} is the \emph{probability} that a nucleus will \emph{decay per unit time}. 
    \item The number \(N\) of undecayed nuclei is such that \(A=-\frac{dN}{dt}=\lambda N\).
    \item The number \(N\) of undecayed nuclei, mass \(m\) of radioactive sample, activity \(A\), and count rate \(C\) all follow the equation \(y=y_0e^{-\lambda t}\) (\(y=N,m,A,C\)).
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{half-life} \(t_{1/2}\) of a \emph{radioactive isotope} is the \emph{average time} taken for its \emph{activity to be halved}. \emph{Note.} \(\lambda t_{1/2}=ln(2)\).

            \item In a beta decay, a \emph{neutrino} is emitted along with the \(\beta\)-particle, carrying away some kinetic energy and momentum. Hence, the electron emission may not be collinear, in the opposite direction of, the recoil of the nucleus.

    \item Biological effects of radiation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Direct effects. When radiation interacts with DNA, affecting (or even breaking) the bonds within, it impacts the ability of a cell to reproduce and survive. Mutations may also occur, eventually leading to cancer.
        \item Indirect effects. When radiation interacts with and breaks the bonds in water molecules, it creates free radicals: molecules which are highly reactive due to the presence of unpaired electrons. These free radicals form compounds which initiates harmful chemical reactions within cells, causing them to be destroyed.

        \label{table:uncertainty-rules}
    \end{table}
    \item Always take the average of three measurements (and show the working for the averaging explicitly) wherever possible. This reduces the effect of random error on the value of \rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\,, hence making it more precise.
    \item Always write the associated units for angles, be it \(\theta^{\circ}\) or \(\theta\) rad.
    \item After finishing calculations for a question, always check whether the number of s.f. or d.p. is correct. See table \ref{table:dpsf}.
    \item \emph{Note.} Whenever a physical quantity is given --- even a resistor clearly labelled ``\(10\Omega\)'' --- we still must account for its dpsf. However, if it's the number of turns/number of oscillations/etc, do not account for its dpsf.
    \item \emph{Note.} Even for physical constants --- such as \(e=1.60\cdot 10^{-19}\) --- their dpsf should also be taken into account! However, mathematical constants, like \(\pi\), can be disregarded in dpsf considerations. 
    \item Percentage uncertainty of stopwatch,
    \[\frac{\Delta t}{t}=\frac{0.2}{\langle t \rangle}\cdot 100\%=\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\,\%\ (1\ s.f.).\]
    \item Be careful of which quantities you are calculating. For example, in determining the radius \(r\) of an object, we might first measure its diameter \(d\). Take caution to remember to calculate \(r=d/2\), and \emph{not} carelessly write \(r=d\).  
    \item If it's difficult to measure a quantity accurately, we should account for it when calculating uncertainties. E.g. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The base of a beaker is not flat. So its height \(h\) (measured with vernier calipers) has uncertainty \(\Delta h=0.2\) cm, rather than the usual \(0.01\) cm.
        \item It may be difficult to precisely measure the height \(h\) of a suspended object (with a metre rule). So, we use \(\Delta h=0.2\) cm, instead of the usual \(0.1\) cm. 
        \item It is difficult to maintain protraction when measuring an angle \(\theta\) (freehand) between, say, a metre rule and a string. Therefore, we account for this by taking \(\Delta\theta=3^\circ\), in place of the usual \(1^\circ\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Make the retort stands face inwards to increase stability
\end{itemize}
\section{Tables \& Graphing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define new variables --- i.e. ones that the question has not defined --- clearly. E.g. let \(n\) be the number of oscillations.
    \item Place all raw data on the left and leave space on the right to add extra columns.
    \item For the raw data for \(n\) oscillations, we can write it in this way:
    \begin{table}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|Sc|Sc|Sc|Sc|Sc|}
            \hline
            \(n\) & \(nT_1\)/s & \(nT_2\)/s & \(nT_3\)/s & \(T\)/s\\

        \caption{Presentation of data for oscillations.}
        \label{table:raw-data-for-n-oscillations}
    \end{table} 
    % \item Ignore the dpsf of counting numbers, such as the number of oscillations \(n\). 
    \item Look out for
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Correct column headings
        \item Dpsf of raw data
        \item Dpsf of calculated data
        \item Number of datasets (see Table \ref{table:practical-graph-points})
    \end{enumerate}
    \item We should have at least six readings to plot.
    \item The dependent variable is always plotted as the horizontal axis.
    \item Always include axis labels for every big square / every 2.0 cm.
    \item When drawing a best fit line, take note of the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The number of points above and below the line should differ by at most one.
        \item Do not draw a \textcolor{red}{`lopsided' graph}, as that is unlikely to be the \textcolor{green!70!black}{best fit line}.

    \item Linearisation statement: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The equation can be rewritten as \(y=mx+c\). E.g. \(\frac{1}{L}=A+Ar\cdot\frac{1}{R_2}\).
        \item Plot \(y\) against \(x\). Then, if a straight line is obtained, the vertical intercept is \(c\) and the gradient is \(m\). 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Draw a gradient triangle using dotted lines and label the selected points (do not mark these points out using a dot/cross/etc).
    \item Always check that the two points selected for calculating gradient are stated to the correct number of decimal places, corresponding to half the smallest square.
    \item Follow the dpsf of the graph when calculating gradient. But follow the least sf of the graph and table when relating the gradient to a physical quantity.
    \begin{example}{}{}

        Suppose that, using values from our graph, \(y_2-y_1\) and \(x_2-x_1\) have \(m_y\) and \(m_x\) s.f., respectively. Then, 
        \[\text{gradient}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\rule{0.5cm}{0.01mm}\ (\min\{m_x,m_y\}\text{ s.f.})\]
        but
        \[a=\text{gradient}=\rule{0.5cm}{0.01mm}\ (\min\{n_x,n_y,m_x,m_y\}\text{ s.f.}).\]
    \end{example}
    \item Suppose we want to draw a new line such that its vertical intercept is the same as our best fit line, but our horizontal axis does not start from zero. Then, just ensure that the lines do not intersect.
\end{itemize}
\section{Questions post-graphing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item State/explain whether or not the results of your experiment supports the relationship that \rule{1cm}{0.05mm}\,.
    \[\text{Percentage difference}=\frac{k_{\text{larger}}-k_{\text{smaller}}}{k_{\text{larger}}}\cdot 100\%.\]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Since the percentage difference of \(k=\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%>\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%=\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%={}\)the percentage uncertainty of \(\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\)\,, the results of the experiment does not support the suggested relationship.
        \item Since the percentage difference of \(k=\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%\leq\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%=\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%={}\)the percentage uncertainty of \(\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\)\,, the results of the experiment supports the suggested relationship.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Use your values in (f)(ii) to plot another point \(Z\) on your graph. State whether this point agrees with the pattern of the other points on your graph, with reference to your values in (a)(v) --- where we obtained two values for \(y\) (e.g. current \(I\)).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Calculate the difference in current \(\Delta y_1\) between the \(y\) value obtained from the graph and the \(y\) value obtained in (f)(ii).
        \item Calculate half the range 
        \[\Delta y_2\coloneq\frac{y_{\text{higher}}-y_{\text{smaller}}}{2}\] 
        between the two values of \(y\) obtained in (a)(v).
        \item Since \(\Delta y_1> \Delta y_2\), this point \(Z\) does not agree with the pattern of the other points on the graph.
        \item Since \(\Delta y_1<\Delta y_2\), this point \(Z\) agrees with the pattern of the other points on the graph.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Avoid writing ``\dots because \rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm} is \textcolor{red}{not equal to} \rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}''. Rather, we should say ``\dots because \rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm} is \textcolor{green!70!black}{far from/near to/close to} \rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}''. 
    \item NY's suggested format for writing sources of error:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is error is/what causes the error, 
        \item Which raw data are affected.
    \end{itemize}
    An example. It is difficult to release the ball from the exact position (what the error is), as the ball is only released by a free hand, which is unsteady (what causes the error). This results in imprecise values of \(h\) (which raw data are affected).
    \item Examples of (i) significant sources of error and (ii) the ways to remedy them.

                \item Replace the rubber band with a brightly coloured thin string and tie a loop around the cylinder.

            (Experiment 02) One's hand is not steady and cannot release the object from the same velocity/position consistently.

        \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth-25.2pt}
            Use a ruler/retort stand/etc to hold the object in a stable position before release so the initial velocity is constant.

        \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth-25.2pt}
            (Experiment 05) The upper string might not be parallel to the ground as it is just an estimate by the human eye. Hence, the value of \(h\) would be inaccurate.
        \end{minipage}&
        \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth-25.2pt}
            A ruler and a set square can be used to ensure that the string is perpendicular to the retort stand, which is perpendicular to the tabletop. Hence, this makes the values of \(h\) more accurate.

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item It is difficult to ascertain the extreme position of the ball accurately as it is only at rest instantaneously. This results in imprecision.
                \item It is difficult to release the ball with constant height.

            (Experiment 15) The paper cone is flimsy and cannot hold a perfect circular shape at the base of the cone. Hence, this causes the values at \(\theta\) to be smaller than expected. So, precision is lost for the values of \(h\), \(y\), and \(x\).
        \end{minipage}&
        \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth-25.2pt}
            Use a plastic cone, so that the measurements for \(h\), \(x\), and \(y\) are more precise, as the shape of the cone cannot change.

    \item For \emph{short} planning questions, we can reference the question's diagram(s). But we must include \emph{our own} for \emph{long} planning questions.
    \item In testing for a linear relationship, we must state that the best fit line should be a \emph{straight line}. If we're testing for direct proportionality, this line should also \emph{cut through the origin}.
