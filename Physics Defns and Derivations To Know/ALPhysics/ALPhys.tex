\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Distance} is defined as the total length of \emph{path} travelled.
    \item \textit{Velocity} is defined as the rate of change of displacement.
    \item \textit{Acceleration} is defined as the rate of change of velocity.
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Dynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Newton's First Law of Motion} states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion at constant velocity in a straight line in the absence of an \emph{external} resultant force.
    \item The \textit{linear momentum} of a body is the product of its mass and velocity. The linear momentum is in the \emph{same direction} as it velocity.
    \item \textit{Newton's Second Law of Motion} states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and occurs \emph{in the direction} of the resultant force.
    \item \textit{Newton's Third Law of Motion} states that if body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts a force of the \emph{same type} that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on body A.
    \item \textit{Impulse} is defined as the product of \emph{average} force acting on an object and the time for which the force acts.
    \item The \textit{Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum} states that the total momentum of a system remains constant provided no \emph{external} resultant force acts on the system.

\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Hooke's Law} states that the force is directly proportional to the extension in a material if its \emph{limit of proportionality} is not exceeded.
    \item The \textit{center of gravity} of an object is the point at which the entire weight of a body may be considered to act.
    \item The \textit{moment} of a force is equal to the product of the force and the \emph{perpendicular} distance of the \emph{line of action} of the force from the pivot. It is also the turning effect of a force.
    \item \textit{Torque of a couple} is defined as the product of one of the forces and the \emph{perpendicular} distance between the \emph{lines of action} of the forces.
    \item The \textit{Principle of Moments} states that if a body is in equilibrium, the sum of all the clockwise moments about \emph{any axis} must be equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments about the \emph{same axis}.
    \item \textit{Density} is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance.
    \item \textit{Pressure} is defined as force per unit area, where the force is \emph{acting perpendicularly} to the area.
    \item Deriving \(p=\rho gh\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider a point at a depth \(h\) below the surface of a liquid of density \(\rho\). 
        \item The force \(F\) acting perpendicularly on a surface area \(A\) at depth \(h\) is due to the weight of the liquid column above \(A\) to give pressure \(p\). Thus, \(p=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{mg}{A}=\frac{\rho Ah}{g}=\rho gh\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Upthrust} is the upward force exerted by a fluid on a body immersed in the fluid (due to pressure difference in the fluid).
    \item \textit{The origin of upthrust:} Upthrust is a result of the pressure difference between top and bottom surfaces of the body, resulting in a net upwards force being exerted on the body by the third medium in which the body is located.
    \item \textit{Archimedes' Principle} states that when a body is totally or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upward force (upthrust) equal to the weight of fluid displaced.
    \item \textit{The Principle of Floatation} states that, for any object floating in \emph{equilibrium}, the upthrust is equal to the weight of the object.
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Work, Energy, and Power}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Work done} is defined as the product of a force and the displacement in the direction of the force.
    \item \textit{One joule of work} is defined as the work done by a force of 1 Newton when its \emph{point of application} moves through a distance of 1 metre in the direction of the force.
    \item \textit{Energy} is defined as the ability to do work.
    \item \textit{The Principle of Conservation of Energy} states that energy can neither be created or destroyed in \emph{any process}. It can be transformed from one form to another, and transferred from one body to another.
    \item Deriving \(E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\): 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider a constant horizontal applied force \(F\) acting on an object of mass \(m\) travelling with initial velocity \(u\) to reach a final velocity \(v\) over a displacement \(s\). 
        \item For uniform acceleration, \(v^2=u^2+2as\) so \(as=\frac{1}{2}(v^2-u^2)\). Combined with Newton's Second Law, \(W=Fs=mas=\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mu^2\). When the object starts from rest, \(u=0\). 
        \item By conservation of energy,\emph{ the work done by force \(F\) must be converted into the kinetic energy \(E_k\) of the object}. Hence, \(E_k=W=\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}m(0)^2=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The \textit{Work-Energy Theorem} states that the net work done by \emph{external} forces acting on a particle is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the particle.
    \item Deriving \(E_p=mgh\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider an object from the Earth's surface --- which is taken as the reference for zero gravitational potential energy --- raised up by a \emph{constant force \(F\) equal to and opposite to the weight \(mg\)} of the object such that the object moves up at \emph{constant velocity} to a height \(h_2\). 
        \item Thus, the object moves at constant speed so \(\Delta E_k=0\). Therefore, 
        \begin{align*}
            \Delta E_p&= W\\
            E_p-0&=Fs\\
            E_p&=mgh.
        \end{align*}
        Where \(E_p\) is the gravitational potential energy at height \(h\) above the Earth's surface.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Know how to \(\Delta E_p=\frac{1}{2}kx^2\) from area under graph.
    \item \textit{Power} is defined as the rate of doing work.
    \item Derive \(P=Fv\): \(P=\frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}t}=\frac{F\text{d}s}{\text{d}t}=Fv\).
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Temperature and Ideal Gases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics} If bodies \(A\) and \(B\) are separately in thermal equilibrium with body \(C\), then bodies \(A\) and \(B\) are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
    \item \textit{One mole} is defined as the amount of substance that contains as many elementary particles as there are atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12.
    \item \textit{Avogadro's Constant \(N_A\)} is the number of atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12.

\chapter{First Law of Thermodynamics}

\chapter{Gravitational Fields}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Newton's Law of Gravitation} states that the force of attraction between any two point masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.
    \item A \textit{gravitational field} is a region in space where mass experiences a gravitational force acting on it.
    \item Gravitational field strength at a point is defined as the gravitational force per unit mass acting on a small mass placed at that point
    \item The \textit{gravitational potential energy} of a mass at a point is defined as the work done by an \emph{external agent} in bringing the mass \emph{from infinity} to that point (without any net change in kinetic energy).
    \item \textit{Gravitational potential} at a point is defined as the work done per unit mass by an \emph{external agent} in bringing a mass \emph{from infinity} to that point (without a change in kinetic energy).
    \item Escape velocity is the \emph{minimum} velocity a mass needs to be projected from the \emph{surface} of the moon in order to have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the gravitational field it experiences and \emph{move to infinity}.
    \item Escape velocity \(v_\text{min}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}\) (where Min \(E_k\) needed is the gain in \(E_p\) to reach infinity).
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}[label=\(\square\)]
    \item \[
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large, column sep=large]
     U_G=-\frac{GMm}{r} \arrow{r}{-\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}r}} \arrow[swap]{d}{\frac{1}{m}} & F_G=-\frac{GMm}{r^2} \arrow[swap]{d}{\frac{1}{m}} \\
     \phi=-\frac{GM}{r} \arrow{r}{-\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}r}} & g=-\frac{GM}{r^2}\\
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\item \(U_G=m\phi\) \& \(\Delta U_G=m\Delta\phi\).
\item \(U_G\) is negative because infinity is taken as the reference point for zero potential energy. The work done against gravitational force in bringing a mass from infinity to that point is negative.
\item Gravitational force provides the centripetal force:
\begin{align*}
    F_G&=F_c\\
    \frac{GMm}{r^2}&=mr\omega^2=mr\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2\\
    T^2&=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3\\
    T^2 &\propto r^3
\end{align*}
\item Gravitational force provides the centripetal force:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    && F_G&=F_c\\
    &\text{For \(A\):}& \hspace{1cm} \frac{Gm_Am_B}{(r_A+r_B)^2}&=m_Ar_A\omega^2\\
    &\text{For \(B\):}& \frac{Gm_Am_B}{(r_A+r_B)^2}&=m_Br_B\omega^2
\end{alignat*}
The center of mass of the system is at point \(P\) where 
\[m_Ar_A=m_Br_B\]
such that both stars have the same angular velocity \(\omega\).
\item For binary star systems, notice that \emph{orbital radius is replaced by the stars' separation}:
\begin{align*}
    m_Ar_A&=m_Br_B& && \frac{Gm_Am_B}{(r_A+r_B)^2}&=m_Br_B\omega^2\\
    r_A+r_B&=\frac{m_B}{m_A}r_B+r_B& &\text{so}& &=\frac{m_Am_B}{m_A+m_B}(r_A+r_B)\omega^2\\
    r_B&=\frac{m_A}{m_A+m_B}(r_A+r_B)& && &\\
\end{align*}
So, rearranging, we have
\[\omega^2=\frac{G(m_A+m_B)}{(r_A+r_B)^3}=\frac{Gm_A}{r_B(r_A+r_B)^2} \qquad\text{and}\qquad T^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{G(m_A+m_B)}(r_A+r_B)^3.\]
\item Geostationary orbit facts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Only one such orbit at a \emph{fixed} distance of \(4.2\times10^7\text{m}\) from Earth's center,
    \item Orbital period of 24 hours,
    \item Satellite's plane of orbit coincides with the equatorial plane of the Earth,
    \item Orbits West to East (in the same direction as Earth's rotation). 
\end{enumerate}
\item Equipotential lines are not equally spaced because the gravitational field strength is not constant but decreases as one goes away from the Earth.
\item Assumptions made in the theory (e.g. in deriving \(g=-\frac{GM}{r^2}\)):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The bodies are separated by distances so large they can be considered as point particles (i.e. separation >> radius).
    \item The bodies are homogenous spheres (constant density throughout the sphere).
    \item The bodies have masses distributed symmetrically around the center in uniform layers.
    \item In the absence of other masses.

\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Simple harmonic motion} is defined as the motion of a body whose acceleration is directly proportional to its displacement from a fixed point (equilibrium position) and is always directed towards that fixed point.
    \item A \textit{freely oscillating} system oscillates at its own \textit{natural frequency} without \emph{external} influences other than the \emph{initial impulse when displaced} from its equilibrium position, with \emph{no dissipation} of energy.
    \item \textit{Damped oscillations} are oscillations in which the amplitude diminishes with time as a result of \emph{dissipative forces} that reduce the total energy of the oscillations.
    \item A system is in \textit{forced oscillations} when it is forced to oscillate at a frequency other than the natural frequency by a \emph{periodic external} force.
    \item \textit{Resonance} is a phenomenon that occurs when the frequency at which an object is being made to vibrate (the forced frequency of vibration) is equal equal to its natural frequency of vibration.

\chapter{Wave Motion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textit{progressive} wave is a wave in which \emph{energy is carried} from one point to another by means of \emph{vibrations or oscillations} within the wave. Particles within the wave are \emph{not transported along} the wave.
    \item A \textit{phase} is an angle which gives a measure of the \emph{fraction of a cycle} that has been \emph{completed} by an oscillating particle or by a wave.
    \item \emph{Intensity} of a wave is the wave energy incident per unit time per unit area \emph{normal} to the wave.
    \item \textit{Polarisation} of a wave refers to the \emph{confinement} of oscillations in \emph{only} one plane. The plane of oscillations is \emph{parallel} to the direction of energy transfer.  
    \item Malus' Law states that the intensity of a beam of \emph{plane polarised light} after passing through a rotatable polariser is directly proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle through which the polariser is rotated from the position that gives maximum intensity.

\chapter{Superposition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Principle of Superposition}: When two or more waves of the \emph{same type}, meet at \emph{a point in space}, the \emph{resultant displacement} of the waves at any point is the \emph{vector sum} of the \emph{displacements} due to \emph{each wave acting independently} at that point.
    \item \emph{Stationary waves} are waves whose \emph{waveforms does not advance} and there is \emph{no net translation of energy}. The \emph{amplitude} of the waves varies according to \emph{position} from zero at the nodes to a maximum at the antinodes.
    \item A stationary wave is formed when two \emph{progressive} waves
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Having the \emph{same frequency} and \emph{same speed}
        \item Travel in \emph{opposite directions} towards each other
        \item Have \emph{similar amplitudes}
        \item Are unpolarised, or polarised along the same axis
        \item Are \emph{superposed}

        Explain, with reference to resonance, why the loudness of sound changes as the water level changes.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Natural frequency of vibration depends on length of air column.
            \item When fork frequency is equal to natural frequency/odd multiple of fundamental frequency, resonance occurs. There is maximum energy transfer and maximum amplitude of vibrations, leading to maximum loudness.
            \item When fork frequency is not equal to natural frequency, no resonance occurs and loudness drops.

    \item If a tube achieves stationary waves at fundamental frequency \(f\), then reducing \(f\)/increasing \(\lambda\) will not result in stationary waves.

    \item Large amount of diffraction occurs when the width of slit is about the same as the wavelength.
    \item The wavelength before and after diffraction should be around the same.

\chapter{Currents of Electricity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{number density} \(n\) is defined as the number of particles per unit volume.
    \item The \emph{drift velocity} \(v\) is the \emph{average} velocity at which \emph{charge carriers} move through a \emph{conductor} when there is \emph{electric current in the conductor}.
    \item Deriving the equation \(I=nAvq\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Assume that the \emph{current is constant}. Then, \(I=\frac{Q}{t}\).
        \hspace*{0pt}\hfill \(\highlight[yellow]{[n]}\)
        \item Assume that there are \(N\) charge carriers passing through a cross-sectional area \(A\) in time \(t\), and that \emph{each} of them carries an \emph{identical amount of charge} \(q\). Then, the \emph{total charge} that passing through \(A\) in time \(t\) is
        \[Q=Nq \tag*{\(\highlight[yellow]{[N,A(t),Q(t)]}\)}.\]
        \item Assume that the \emph{number density} \(n\) of charge carriers is \emph{uniform}, and let \(V\) be the volume covered by the current in time \(t\). Thus,
        \[N=nV \tag*{\(\highlight[yellow]{[n,V(t)]}\)}.\]
        \item Furthermore, since the current travels at some velocity \(v\),
        \[V=A\Delta x=Avt \tag*{\(\highlight[yellow]{[v]}\)}.\]
        \item Therefore,

    \item \emph{Ohm's Law} states that the \emph{current} flowing in a \emph{conductor} is \emph{directly proportional} to the \emph{potential difference across it} under \emph{constant physical conditions}.
    \item \emph{Resistance} is defined as the \emph{ratio} of the \emph{potential difference across} the conductor to the \emph{current} flowing through it.
    \item \emph{Resistivity} \(\rho\) is the \emph{proportionality constant} between the \emph{dimensions of a specimen of a material} and its \emph{resistance} such that

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Coulomb's Law} states that the \emph{magnitude} of the \emph{electric force} between two \emph{point charges} is directly proportional to the product of the charges, and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.
    \item The constant \(\varepsilon_0\) is the permittivity of \emph{free space} (\(\varepsilon_0\) is applicable only in air or a vacuum).
    \item Sign of \(F_E\):
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|Sc|Sc|}
            \hline
            \(F_E\) & Direction\\
            \hline
            Positive & Repulsive\\
            \hline
            Negative & Attractive\\ 
            \hline
        \end{tabular}  
    \end{center}
    
  \item The sign of the electric force does \emph{not} represent the \emph{direction} of the electric force. It only informs us whether the force is attractive or repulsive. So, when calculating the \emph{resultant} electric force, we need to account for the direction ourselves.

    \item An \emph{electric field} is a \emph{region in space} where a \emph{charge experiences an electric force}.
    \item How to draw electric field lines: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Lines cannot intersect} one another.
        \item Lines must \emph{begin from positive charges} and \emph{end on negative charges}.
        \item Arrows show the \emph{direction of force} exerted on a positive test charge.
        \item The \emph{greater} the electric field strength, the \emph{closer} together field lines are drawn.

  \item Charge distribution on a conducting sphere: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Excess charges are forced to the surface of the conductor until the electric field inside the conductor is zero. 
    \item \emph{Outside} the conductor, the electric field is the \emph{same} as that of an isolated point charge equal to the excess charge. 
  \end{itemize}
  \item Properties of conductors in \emph{electrostatic equilibrium}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{electric field is zero inside} a conductor (regardless of shape).
    \item So, the \emph{entire conductor} is at the \emph{same potential}.
    \item Just outside the conductor, the e-field lines are \emph{perpendicular to its surface}, starting and ending on charges on the surface.
    \item \emph{Excess charges} resides exclusively on \emph{the surfaces} of a conductor.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Electric field strength between two charged parallel plates is uniform everywhere between the plates, except at both ends of the plates. 
  \item Also, \emph{charges} between the plates experience \emph{uniform acceleration}.

  \item Magnitude of electric field strength between the plates:
  \[E=\frac{dV}{dr}=\frac{\Delta V}{d}.\]
  \item The \emph{electric potential energy} of a point charge in an electric field is defined as the \emph{work done by an external agent} in bringing the point charge from infinity to that point (without any net change in kinetic energy). 
  \item The \emph{electric potential} at a point in an electric field is defined as the \emph{work done} per unit \emph{positive} charge, by an external agent, in bringing a \emph{small} test charge from infinity to that point (without any net change in kinetic energy). 
  \item Let \(U\) be the electric potential energy, and \(V\) the electric potential. Then,
  \[U=qV \qquad\text{and}\qquad \Delta U=q\Delta V.\]
  \item ~

    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  \item The \emph{electric potential} at a point \(X\) due to a \emph{system} of point charges \(q_i\) is the algebraic sum of the electric potential \(V_i\) due to each individual charge \(q_i\) which is distance \(r_i\) away from \(X\). That is, 
  \[V=\sum_{i}{V_i}=\sum_{i}^{}{\frac{q_i}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r_i}}.\]
  \item The \emph{potential energy} of a \emph{system} of charges \(q_i\) is the work done to assemble it. This is the sum of energies \(U_{ij}\) needed to bring each charge \(q_i\) to the charges \(q_j\) (for \(i>j\)) already present. In other words letting \(r_{ij}\) be the distance of \(q_i\) from \(q_j\), we have 
  \[U=\sum_{i>j}{U_{ij}}=\sum_{i>j}^{}{\frac{q_iq_j}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r_{ij}}}.\]

    \item For \(n\) identical resistors in parallel, which are each of resistance \(R\), we have \(R_{\text{effective}}=R/n\). Furthermore, the effective resistance is at most the resistance of the smallest resistor, i.e. \(R_{\text{effective}}\leq R_i\) for each \(i\). In fact, the inequality is strict when the number of resistors in parallel \(n\geq 2\).
    \item To resolve tricky systems of resistors, use the fact that electric potential is constant along a wire.

\chapter{Electromagnetic Induction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Magnetic flux} is the \emph{product} of \emph{an area} and the component of \emph{magnetic flux density perpendicular} to that area.
    \item In other words, let \(A\) be an area in a uniform magnetic field, of flux density \(B_\perp\) perpendicular to \(A\). Then, the magnetic flux \(\Phi\) through \(A\) is
    \[\Phi=B_\perp A.\]
    \item The area \(A\) here is a \emph{vector}! When we flip it through \(\pi\) radians, the magnetic flux through it is now \(-\Phi=-B_\perp A\). 
    \item \emph{One weber} is the \emph{magnitude of magnetic flux} through an \emph{area of} \(1\text{m}^2\) when a \emph{magnetic field of} \(1\text{T}\) acts \emph{perpendicularly into} the area.
    \item \emph{Magnetic flux linkage} through a coil is defined as the \emph{product} of the \emph{number of turns} of the coil and the magnetic flux through each turn of the coil.
    \item The magnetic flux through a coil of \(N\) turns is hence
    \[N\Phi=NB_\perp A.\]
    \item \emph{Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction} states that the \emph{e.m.f. induced} in a \emph{conductor} is \emph{directly proportional} to the \emph{rate of change of magnetic flux linkage}.
    \item \emph{Lenz's Law} states that the \emph{direction of the induced e.m.f.} is such that it may produce \emph{an effect} that \emph{opposes the change} causing it.
    \item Lenz's Law is a consequence of conservation of energy. Mechanical work done to enable the change in magnetic flux linkage is converted into electrical energy.
    \item Faraday's and Lenz's Laws imply that the e.m.f generated is
    \[E=-(N\Phi)'=-(NB_\perp A)'.\]
    (The negative sign indicates that the induced e.m.f. opposes the change in magnetic flux linkage.)

Then, let \(\text{O}\) be the centre of the disk, and pick any point \(P\) along the circumference of the disk. We see that \(A'\), the area swept by \(\text{OP}\), is \(\pi r^2f\). So, by Faraday's Law,
    \[E=B\pi r^2f.\]

\chapter{Alternating Current}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An \emph{alternating current (a.c.) source} creates an electrical \emph{current} that varies in magnitude \emph{and} direction \emph{periodically with time}, as opposed to a \emph{direct current} (d.c.) source where the \emph{direction} of the current stays \emph{constant}. 
    \item Alternating current \emph{must change direction}. For instance, the following two functions, namely \(I=sin(t)+1\) and \(I=cos(t)+1\), are both (varying) direct currents.

    \item A \(k\,\text{V}\) \(f\,\text{Hz}\) a.c. supply is one which has \(\text{V}_\text{rms}=k\) and frequency \(f\).
    \item The \emph{root-mean-square} (r.m.s.) value \(I_{\text{rms}}\) (or \(V\text{rms}\)) of an \emph{alternating current} (or alternating voltage) is the value of a \emph{steady direct current} (or direct voltage) that would produce the \emph{same average power} in a given resistor.
    \item We denote the mean value of a quantity \(x\) by \(\langle x \rangle\). So, \(x_{rms}=\sqrt{\langle x^2 \rangle}\), and it also holds that
    \[\langle P \rangle=I_\text{rms}^2R=\frac{V_\text{rms}^2}{R}.\]
    \item Steps to determine the rms value: square \(\to\) mean  \(\to\) root.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Square all values of \(I\) (or \(V\)).
        \item Find the mean square value \(\langle I^2 \rangle\) (or \(\langle V^2 \rangle\)). This is just the area under the graph of \(I^2\) (or \(V^2\)) against \(t\) in one period.
        \item Square root the value obtained above.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Note that for a \emph{full wave sinusoidal} alternating current (which an be assumed unless otherwise stated), 
    \[\langle P \rangle=\frac{1}{2}P_0,\qquad V_{\text{rms}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}V_0,\quad\text{and}\quad I_{\text{rms}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}I_0.\]
    \item Transformers. Let \(N_P\), \(V_P\), and \(I_P\) be the number of turns, voltage, and current, respectively, in the primary winding. Similarly define \(N_S\), \(V_S\), and \(I_S\) for the secondary winding. Then,
    \[\text{the turns ratio}\coloneq\frac{N_S}{N_P}=\frac{V_S}{V_P}=\frac{I_P}{I_S}.\]
    (To quickly determine which side carries a greater voltage, we can use the principle of `more turns, more voltage'.)
    \item A step up transformer is one that increases voltage, i.e. \(V_S>V_P\) (or \(N_S>N_P\)).
    \item A step down transformer is one that decreases voltage, i.e. \(V_P>V_S\) (or \(N_P>N_S\)).

    \item Transformers cannot be used for \emph{constant} direct current. Since there is no change in voltage/current, no emf will be (constantly) induced in the secondary coil. 
    \item When the direct current varies, however, there will be an \emph{alternating} current induced.
    \item Energy loss in a transformer.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Winding resistance. Current flowing through the windings causes \emph{resistive heating} of the conductors.
        \item Hysteresis losses. Each time the \emph{magnetic field is reversed}, a small amount of energy is lost due to hysteresis within the core.
        \item Magnetostriction. Magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic fore causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field. This produces a \emph{buzzing sound} and can cause losses due to \emph{frictional heating}.
        \item Mechanical losses. The alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating forces between the primary and secondary windings. These cause vibrations within nearby metalwork, adding to the \emph{buzzing noise} and \emph{consuming a small amount of power}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Power is typically transmitted at high voltages to minimise the power lost during transmission.
    \item Rectification.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \emph{half-wave rectification} converts only \emph{half} of the a.c. into d.c. by allowing current flow in only one direction.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item The diode is \emph{forward-biased} and has almost zero resistance, allowing the flow of current through the circuit.
                \item There is negligible p.d. (approximately zero) across the diode due to the low resistance.
                \item Thus, p.d. \(V_R\) across the resistor \(R\) is equal to the a.c. input voltage.
                \item So, when the diode is forward-biased, \(V_R\) follows the a.c. supply.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Latter half cycle (`negative' \(V\) and \(I\))
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The diode is now \emph{reverse-biased} and has almost infinite resistance, such that only a negligible current flows through it.
                \item The p.d. across the diode is equal to the a.c. input supply voltage as its resistance is very much larger than \(R\).
                \item Thus, the p.d. \(V_R\) across \(R\) is negligible.
                \item So, when the diode is reverse-biased, \(V_R=0\).
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

            \item This absorption of the photon then leads to a gain in energy for the electron.

        The \emph{rate} at which electrons were ejected, and therefore, the \emph{photocurrent} produced is proportional to the \emph{intensity} of the light.&

    A sharp cut-off/minimum wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\)& 
    % When the kinetic energy of an incident electron is fully lost as a single photon, that photon has maximum kinetic energy.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An X-ray photon has maximum kinetic energy --- i.e. has minimum wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\) --- when the kinetic energy of an incident electron is fully lost as that photon. i.e. \(E_k=hc/\lambda_{\text{min}}\).
        \item Furthermore, each incident electron has kinetic energy \(E_k=eV\).
        \item So, we solve \(hc/\lambda_{\text{min}}=eV\), telling us that \(\lambda_{\text{min}}=\frac{hc}{eV}\).
        \item No emitted X-ray photon has a lower wavelength \(\lambda<\lambda_{\text{min}}\), because such a photon would have 
        energy exceeding \(hc/\lambda_{\text{min}}\), and hence, exceeding the kinetic energy of all incident electrons. 
        % energy \(hc/\lambda>hc/\lambda_{\text{min}}=E_k=eV\), and hence, require a more energetic electron --- i.e. an electron accelerated through a larger potential difference \(V\)

    A broad continuous spectrum known as the \emph{Bremsstrahlung continuum}. (Bremsstrahlung is braking radiation in German.)&
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When incident electrons pass by the nucleus, they are accelerated.
        \item Their kinetic energies are lost through the emission of Bremsstrahlung.
        % , which are \(X\)-ray photons of a range of energies.
        \item Since the magnitude of the acceleration experienced by the incident electrons varies and is not discrete, the wavelengths of the emitted photons have a continuous distribution.

    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{unified atomic mass unit} \(u\) is equivalent to \emph{one-twelfth} of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. i.e. 1 \(u=1.66\cdot 10^{-27}\) kg.
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{mass defect} is the amount by which the mass of an atomic \emph{nucleus} is less than the sum of the masses of its \emph{constituent particles}. i.e.
    \[\text{mass defect }\Delta m=\text{sum of masses of nucleons}-\text{mass of nucleus}.\]
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{binding energy} of a nucleus is the amount of energy that is required to \emph{break a nucleus} into its \emph{constituent nucleons}.
    \item Binding energy is not a form of stored energy. 
    \item Mass-energy equivalence: \(E=mc^2\).
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{binding energy per nucleon} is defined as the \emph{binding energy} of a nucleus divided by the \emph{number of nucleons} in the nucleus.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\AsteriskThin] Radioactive decay is \emph{spontaneous} and \emph{random}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Spontaneous} means that the nucleus decays because it is \emph{unstable}, not because of \emph{external conditions}.
        \item Random means that it is impossible to predict \emph{which} nucleus will delay or \emph{when} a particular nucleus will decay.
    \end{itemize}
    \item[\AsteriskThin] \emph{Background radiation} is the radiation detected by a \emph{radiation counter} when \emph{no radioactive source} is nearby.
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{activity} \(A\) of a radioactive isotope is defined as the number of \emph{nuclear disintegrations per unit time}.
    \item The count rate \(C\) is the rate at which counts are triggered on a ratemeter, by ionising radiation. 
    \item \emph{Note.} The count rate is \emph{not the same} as activity. In fact, \(C\leq A\) because not all emissions --- stemming from radioactive decay --- are counted. Some reasons include:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Not all the radiation is directed towards the detector.
        \item Some of the radiation will be absorbed in the source itself, and by the air between the source and the detector. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{decay constant} \(\lambda\) of a \emph{sample of a radioactive nuclide} is the \emph{probability} that a nucleus will \emph{decay per unit time}. 
    \item The number \(N\) of undecayed nuclei is such that \(A=-\frac{dN}{dt}=\lambda N\).
    \item The number \(N\) of undecayed nuclei, mass \(m\) of radioactive sample, activity \(A\), and count rate \(C\) all follow the equation \(y=y_0e^{-\lambda t}\) (\(y=N,m,A,C\)).
    \item[\AsteriskThin] The \emph{half-life} \(t_{1/2}\) of a \emph{radioactive isotope} is the \emph{average time} taken for its \emph{activity to be halved}. \emph{Note.} \(\lambda t_{1/2}=ln(2)\).

            \item In a beta decay, a \emph{neutrino} is emitted along with the \(\beta\)-particle, carrying away some kinetic energy and momentum. Hence, the electron emission may not be collinear, in the opposite direction of, the recoil of the nucleus.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Biological effects of radiation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Direct effects. When radiation interacts with DNA, affecting (or even breaking) the bonds within, it impacts the ability of a cell to reproduce and survive. Mutations may also occur, eventually leading to cancer.
        \item Indirect effects. When radiation interacts with and breaks the bonds in water molecules, it creates free radicals: molecules which are highly reactive due to the presence of unpaired electrons. These free radicals form compounds which initiates harmful chemical reactions within cells, causing them to be destroyed.

    \item Always take the average of three measurements (and show the working for the averaging explicitly) wherever possible. This reduces the effect of random error on the value of \rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\,, hence making it more precise.
    \item After finishing calculations for a question, always check whether the number of s.f. or d.p. is correct. See table \ref{table:dpsf}.
    \item \emph{Note.} Whenever a physical quantity is given --- even a resistor clearly labelled ``\(10\Omega\)'' --- we still must account for its dpsf. However, if it's the number of turns/number of oscillations/etc, do not account for its dpsf.
    \item \emph{Note.} Even for physical constants --- such as \(e=1.90\cdot 10^{-19}\) --- their dpsf should also be taken into account! However, mathematical constants, like \(\pi\), can be disregarded in dpsf considerations. 
    \item Percentage uncertainty of stopwatch,
    \[\frac{\Delta t}{t}=\frac{0.2}{\langle t \rangle}\cdot 100\%=\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\,\%\ (1\ s.f.).\]
    \item If it's difficult to measure a quantity accurately, we should account for it when calculating uncertainties. E.g. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The base of a beaker is not flat. So its height \(h\) (measured with vernier calipers) has uncertainty \(\Delta h=0.2\) cm, rather than the usual \(0.01\) cm.
        \item It may be difficult to precisely measure the height \(h\) of a suspended object (with a metre rule). So, we use \(\Delta h=0.2\) cm, instead of the usual \(0.1\) cm. 
        \item It is difficult to maintain protraction when measuring an angle \(\theta\) (freehand) between, say, a metre rule and a string. Therefore, we account for this by taking \(\Delta\theta=3^\circ\), in place of the usual \(1^\circ\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\section{Graphing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We should have at least six readings to plot.
    \item The dependent variable is always plotted as the horizontal axis.
    \item Always include axis labels for every big square / every 2.0 cm.
    \item Linearisation statement: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The equation can be rewritten as \(y=mx+c\). E.g. \(\frac{1}{L}=A+Ar\cdot\frac{1}{R_2}\).
        \item Plot \(y\) against \(x\). Then, if a straight line is obtained, the vertical intercept is \(c\) and the gradient is \(m\). 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Draw a gradient triangle using dotted lines and label the selected points (do not mark these points out using a dot/cross/etc).
    \item Always check that the two points selected for calculating gradient are stated to the correct number of decimal places, corresponding to half the smallest square.

\section{Questions post-graphing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item State/explain whether or not the results of your experiment supports the relationship that \rule{1cm}{0.05mm}\,.
    \[\text{Percentage difference}=\frac{k_{\text{larger}}-k_{\text{smaller}}}{k_{\text{larger}}}\cdot 100\%.\]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Since the percentage difference of \(k=\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%>\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%=\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%={}\)the percentage uncertainty of \(\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\)\,, the results of the experiment does not support the suggested relationship.
        \item Since the percentage difference of \(k=\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%\leq\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%=\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\%={}\)the percentage uncertainty of \(\rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}\)\,, the results of the experiment supports the suggested relationship.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Avoid writing ``\dots because \rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm} is \textcolor{red}{not equal to} \rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}''. Rather, we should say ``\dots because \rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm} is \textcolor{green!70!black}{far from/near to/close to} \rule{0.5cm}{0.05mm}''.
    \item NY's suggested format for writing sources of error:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is error is/what causes the error, 
        \item Which raw data are affected.
    \end{itemize}
    An example. It is difficult to release the ball from the exact position (what the error is), as the ball is only released by a free hand, which is unsteady (what causes the error). This results in imprecise values of \(h\) (which raw data are affected).
    \item Examples of (i) significant sources of error and (ii) the ways to remedy them.
