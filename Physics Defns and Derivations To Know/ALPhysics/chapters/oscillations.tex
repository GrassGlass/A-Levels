\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Simple harmonic motion} is defined as the motion of a body whose acceleration is directly proportional to its displacement from a fixed point (equilibrium position) and is always directed towards that fixed point.
    \begin{example}{}{}
        Describe the restoring force that gives rise to oscillations in a simple pendulum.
        \begin{figure}[H]

        \vspace{0.5\baselineskip} The restoring force is the \textcolor{green!70!black}{tangential component of the weight} of the bob, which is normal to the string and points towards the equilibrium position --- where the pendulum is hanging vertically. 

        \vspace{0.5\baselineskip} \emph{Note.} the \textcolor{red}{tension} in the string does not provide the restoring force, since there is no component of tension along the tangential direction of motion.
    \end{example}
    \item A \emph{freely oscillating} system oscillates at its own \emph{natural frequency} without \emph{external} influences other than the \emph{initial impulse when displaced} from its equilibrium position, with \emph{no dissipation} of energy.
    \item \emph{Damped oscillations} are oscillations in which the amplitude diminishes with time as a result of \emph{dissipative forces} that reduce the total energy of the oscillations.
    \item \emph{A forced oscillating system} is one that is driven by an \emph{external periodic driver}. There is \emph{continuous energy input} to the oscillating system by the driver, and the system \emph{oscillates at the driver's frequency}. 
    \item \emph{Resonance} is a phenomenon in which there is \emph{maximum transfer of energy} from the driver to the oscillating system in a \emph{forced oscillation}. The oscillating system achieves \emph{maximum amplitude} during resonance. For an \emph{undamped system}, resonance occurs when the \emph{driving frequency} is \emph{equal} to its \emph{natural frequency} of vibration.

    \item When damping increases:
    \begin{itemize}[label=\(\circ\)]
        \item Amplitude at \emph{all} frequencies decreases.
        \item (Resonance) frequency at max amplitude shifts gradually to lower frequencies.
        \item Peak (max amplitude) becomes flatter.

    \item When drawing the displacement-time graph of a underdamped oscillator, we must show the exponential decay in amplitude:

    The variation with time \(t\) of the total vertical displacement \(y\) of the mass \(M\) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:no-damping-to-light-damping}, when the oscillations are undamped. On Figure \ref{fig:no-damping-to-light-damping}, sketch the variation of time \(t\) of the total vertical displacement \(y\) of mass \(M\) for \textbf{three} complete, lightly damped oscillations of the mass.

        \item Same constant period \hspace*{\fill} [1]
        \item Gradual/continuous decrease in amplitude \hspace*{\fill} [1]
        \item Three complete cycles
    \end{itemize}

(Ideal) Isolated spring systems are in simple harmonic motion, but spring systems in general need not be in simple harmonic motion.
\begin{example}{spring systems are not \emph{always} in simple harmonic motion.}{}
    Consider when a mass \(m\) is dropped onto a massless spring, that is at its equilibrium position. Assume that the mass does not rebound; the spring-mass system moves as one body after the initial collision occurs.
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{../images/mass-spring system.jpg}
        \caption{An illustration of the spring-mass system aforementioned.}
        \label{fig:spring-mass-system}
    \end{figure}
    Then, the net force on the spring-mass system is \(W-F_{\text{spring}}=mg-kx\). Hence, the acceleration of the spring-mass system is \(g-(kx/m)\not\propto x\). i.e. the system does not move in simple harmonic motion.
\end{example}
(Regardless, the maximum speed occurs at the point where \(\text{net }F=0\).)
