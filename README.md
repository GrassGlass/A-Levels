# Shao Hong's Spaghetti Cove (highschool notes)

Hello there (insert Obi-Wan voice). This is my repository for my highschool notes.

## Foreword
- These notes are meant to be summary notes for the core content of each subject, and for the key learning points I have consolidated from doing practice papers. They are *not* meant to be a place for you to learn something from scratch.
- My A-Level Math and Physics notes are the most complete and of the highest quality, out of all my notes in this repository.
- These notes are written, by me for me. So, don't expect uniform quality throughout. Notably, sections I wrote the earliest (time-wise) and/or have not needed to review much are less well-written and with less detail. Conversely, the sections I have revisited frequently have the best writing and highest detail.
- Expect some degree of spaghetti code. My preamble is in a mess, which I have never bothered to clean up ~~I mean, it compiles~~. Some parts of my code are not written in the correct way but held with duct tape ~~but your honor, it compiles~~ — I didn't always have the time nor patience to figure out the best way of doing things, given that JC can get busy. Nowadays, for newer latex projects, I use a far better preamble which also entails minimal spaghetti code.
- The above illustrates my point: my notes, for me. Everyone has different needs their notes should fulfil. That is why I have decided to make the underlying latex code open-source, instead of simply releasing the PDF. Furthermore, I hope that someone from each batch of students will update the code for their syllabus, for their own benefit and so that this repository will remain up-to-date for future generations of students.
- Also, there are bound to be many typos I have not found. So, don't use my notes blindly: my notes do not form a bible of absolute truth and accuracy.
